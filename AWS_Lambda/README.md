Working through the AWS Lambda training from A Cloud Guru

https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-lambda


All code has been developed and tested for use with Python 3.6

You may need to verify the Handler for the lambda functions match with the filename and function uploaded.

In AWS Lambda using Python, the default handler is "lambda_function.lambda_handler", as opposed to the Node.js example of
"index.handler".
